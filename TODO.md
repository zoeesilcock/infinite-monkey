# Todo

## Convert to JSON
* Add serde_json
* Add a top level key

* Write result to a file


# Done

## Don't include the current row id in references.

## Don't recreate pools for each row
* The idea is that they re-use the same pools.

## Basic types of data
* Sequencial number
* Date
* Random text
* Comma separated text
* Hierarcical data (A, A1, A2, B, B1, B2)
* Reference to other row
